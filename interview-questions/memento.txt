The Memento design pattern is one of the 23 Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns. It falls under the behavioral design patterns category, which focuses on how objects interact and behave.

Overview of the Memento Pattern
The Memento pattern allows an object to capture its internal state and save it externally, without exposing its internal details to other objects. This captured state can later be restored to return the object to its previous state, which is useful for features like undo/redo operations.

Intent
Capture and store the current state of an object so it can be restored later.
Encapsulate the state without exposing the object’s internals.
Structure
The Memento pattern typically involves three participants:

Originator

The object whose state needs to be saved and restored.
It creates a Memento and restores its state from a Memento when required.
Memento

Holds the state of the Originator.
The Memento object is immutable to prevent unintended modifications to the saved state.
Caretaker

Manages and stores Memento objects but does not modify or inspect them.
It only knows how to request the Originator to save or restore its state.

When to Use the Memento Pattern
You need undo/redo operations in an application (e.g., text editor or drawing software).
You want to encapsulate object state without exposing it directly.
Saving and restoring snapshots of an object’s state (e.g., in a game, saving the player’s progress).
Implementation Example in C#
Let’s look at a simple example: A text editor that allows the user to undo changes.

csharp
Copy code
// Memento: Stores the state of the Originator
public class TextEditorMemento
{
    public string Content { get; }

    public TextEditorMemento(string content)
    {
        Content = content;
    }
}

// Originator: The text editor whose state we want to save/restore
public class TextEditor
{
    public string Content { get; set; }

    public TextEditorMemento CreateMemento()
    {
        return new TextEditorMemento(Content);
    }

    public void Restore(TextEditorMemento memento)
    {
        Content = memento.Content;
    }
}

// Caretaker: Manages the saved states
public class EditorHistory
{
    private Stack<TextEditorMemento> _history = new Stack<TextEditorMemento>();

    public void Save(TextEditorMemento memento)
    {
        _history.Push(memento);
    }

    public TextEditorMemento Undo()
    {
        if (_history.Count > 0)
        {
            return _history.Pop();
        }
        return null;
    }
}

// Client Code
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var editor = new TextEditor();
        var history = new EditorHistory();

        editor.Content = "Version 1";
        history.Save(editor.CreateMemento());

        editor.Content = "Version 2";
        history.Save(editor.CreateMemento());

        editor.Content = "Version 3";

        Console.WriteLine("Current Content: " + editor.Content);

        // Undo to Version 2
        editor.Restore(history.Undo());
        Console.WriteLine("After Undo: " + editor.Content);

        // Undo to Version 1
        editor.Restore(history.Undo());
        Console.WriteLine("After Undo: " + editor.Content);
    }
}
Explanation
TextEditor (Originator):

Represents the text editor. It can create a memento with its current content and restore its state from a memento.
TextEditorMemento (Memento):

Encapsulates the state of the TextEditor. It only exposes the content through a read-only property.
EditorHistory (Caretaker):

Stores a history of mementos using a stack to implement the undo functionality.
Program (Client):

Simulates changes in the editor’s content and uses the undo functionality provided by the EditorHistory.
Output

Copy code
Current Content: Version 3
After Undo: Version 2
After Undo: Version 1
Advantages of the Memento Pattern
Encapsulation: The internal state of the Originator is not exposed to the Caretaker or external objects.
Undo/Redo Support: Easily implement undo and redo operations.
Separation of Concerns: Originator handles the state, and Caretaker handles the storage of Mementos.
Disadvantages
Memory Consumption: Saving multiple mementos may consume a lot of memory.
Complexity: Managing a large number of mementos can add complexity to the code.
Real-World Examples
Text Editors: Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or any other editor with undo functionality uses a similar concept.
Games: Saving checkpoints or player progress and restoring it on reload.
Software Modeling Tools: Allowing state rollback when editing diagrams.
The Memento pattern ensures state restoration in an encapsulated way, making it useful when an object needs to be rolled back to a previous state without exposing its details to other parts of the application.

In a Learning Management System (LMS), the Memento pattern can be useful for tracking changes and allowing users to revert to previous states. Here are a few practical scenarios where the pattern fits well:

Use Cases for Memento Pattern in an LMS
1. Restoring Course Content Versions
Scenario: Instructors frequently update course materials (like slides, assignments, or quizzes). If they make a mistake or want to revert to a previous version, the LMS can offer a version history with undo functionality.
Solution:
Use the Memento pattern to capture each version of the course content.
If an instructor wants to restore an earlier version, the system retrieves a saved memento object.
Example:

csharp
Copy code
public class CourseContent
{
    public string Content { get; set; }

    public CourseContentMemento Save() => new CourseContentMemento(Content);

    public void Restore(CourseContentMemento memento) => Content = memento.Content;
}

public class CourseContentMemento
{
    public string Content { get; }

    public CourseContentMemento(string content) => Content = content;
}

public class ContentHistory
{
    private Stack<CourseContentMemento> _history = new();

    public void Save(CourseContentMemento memento) => _history.Push(memento);

    public CourseContentMemento Undo() => _history.Count > 0 ? _history.Pop() : null;
}
2. Student Progress Tracking with Checkpoints
Scenario: Students complete online courses or quizzes step-by-step. If a student experiences connectivity issues or wants to resume from where they left off, the system needs to restore their progress.
Solution:
Use the Memento pattern to store progress checkpoints (e.g., completed lessons or quiz attempts).
When a student logs back in, the progress memento restores the last saved state.
Example: Save progress every few lessons:

csharp
Copy code
public class StudentProgress
{
    public int CompletedLessons { get; set; }

    public ProgressMemento SaveProgress() => new ProgressMemento(CompletedLessons);

    public void RestoreProgress(ProgressMemento memento) => CompletedLessons = memento.CompletedLessons;
}

public class ProgressMemento
{
    public int CompletedLessons { get; }

    public ProgressMemento(int completedLessons) => CompletedLessons = completedLessons;
}
3. Quiz Attempt Recovery and Undo for Students
Scenario: A student takes a timed quiz, but the system saves their progress after each question. If they accidentally submit the wrong answer, the LMS could allow them to undo the last attempt (before submitting the final quiz).
Solution:
Store the student's answers in memento objects after each question.
If the student decides to go back to a previous question, the state can be restored from the corresponding memento.
4. Course Design with Drag-and-Drop Elements
Scenario: An instructor uses a drag-and-drop interface to design a course module. If they mistakenly delete or rearrange sections, they can use undo/redo functionality to revert to a prior arrangement.
Solution:
Each time the instructor makes a change, the system saves the current layout as a memento.
Undo and redo operations allow the instructor to move between saved states.
5. Configuration Settings for the LMS Portal
Scenario: Admins modify system settings (such as grading rules, themes, or user permissions). If a misconfiguration occurs, the LMS could allow them to revert to a previously saved configuration.
Solution:
Each set of configuration changes is saved as a memento.
If the admin wants to undo a change, the system restores the previous state.
How the Memento Pattern Helps in an LMS Context
Improves Usability:

By offering undo/redo features, users (like instructors or students) get more control over mistakes.
State Encapsulation:

The state (e.g., content, progress, configuration) is encapsulated inside a memento, ensuring that the rest of the application doesn’t access internal details.
Recovery from Interruptions:

Helps save and restore user progress during unexpected interruptions (e.g., network failures).
Seamless Version Control:

Instructors can revert course content to previous versions without needing to re-upload or rebuild content from scratch.
The Memento pattern in an LMS ensures flexibility, usability, and robustness by helping save, restore, and recover various states during normal operations or disruptions.
